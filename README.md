## ‚öôÔ∏è Setup and Installation

Follow these steps to get PixelAlchemy Studio up and running on your local machine.

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.11 or higher
- **UV**: Installed on your system. If you don't have it, follow the installation instructions at [UV's official website](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/)

### Installation Steps

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/pixel-alchemy-studio.git # Replace with your actual repo URL
   cd pixel-alchemy-studio
   ```

2. **Create and Activate Virtual Environment using UV:**
   ```bash
   uv venv
   source .venv/bin/activate  # On Linux/macOS
   # .venv\Scripts\activate   # On Windows
   ```

3. **Install Dependencies using UV and pyproject.toml:**
   
   Ensure your `pyproject.toml` file has the necessary dependencies listed under `[project.dependencies]`.
   
   Example for `pyproject.toml` (ensure yours matches your project's needs):
   ```toml
   [project]
   name = "pixel_alchemy_studio" # Or "graficador_geometrico" if you prefer
   version = "0.1.0"
   description = "Interactive drawing with AI-powered image and video generation."
   requires-python = ">=3.11"
   dependencies = [
       "pygame>=2.5.0",
       "google-genai>=1.10.0", # Check for the latest Veo-compatible version
       "Pillow>=10.0.0",
       "python-dotenv>=1.0.0"
   ]

   [build-system]
   requires = ["hatchling"]
   build-backend = "hatchling.build"
   ```
   
   Then install dependencies using:
   ```bash
   uv pip sync
   ```

4. **Set Up Google API Key:**
   - Go to [Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/) to get your API key
   - Ensure that the Generative Language API (for Gemini) and the Vertex AI API (Veo model access is enabled for your project) are enabled in your Google Cloud Project
   - **Important for Veo**: Veo is a paid feature. Make sure billing is enabled on your Google Cloud Project associated with the API key
   - Create a file named `.env` in the root directory of the project (`pixel-alchemy-studio/.env`)
   - Add your API key to the `.env` file like this:
     ```
     GOOGLE_API_KEY="YOUR_ACTUAL_API_KEY_HERE"
     ```
   - (A `.env.example` file should be provided in your repository as a template)

## üöÄ How to Run

Once the setup is complete, run the application from the root directory of the project:

```bash
uv run python -m src.graficador.main
```

## üéÆ How to Use

- **Main Interface**: The application window is divided into a drawing canvas on the left and a control panel on the right.

- **Selecting Tools**: Click on buttons in the control panel to select drawing tools or AI functions. Keyboard shortcuts are also available (indicated on buttons).

- **Drawing**:
  - **Pixel (P)**: Click and drag to draw freehand
  - **Lines (L, B), Circle (O), Ellipse (E)**: Click for the first point (e.g., start of line, center of circle/ellipse), then click for the second point (e.g., end of line, point on radius/edge)
  - **B√©zier Curve (Z)**: Click four times to define the two endpoints and two control points
  - **Triangle (T)**: Click three times for the vertices
  - **Rectangle (R)**: Click twice for two opposite corners
  - **Polygon (Y)**: Click for each vertex. Click near the first vertex (within threshold) to close the polygon

- **Choosing Colors**: Click on color swatches in the control panel.

- **Clearing Canvas (C)**: Click the "Clear" button or press 'C'. This also resets AI states.

- **Gemini - Image Generation/Editing (G)**:
  - Press 'G' or click the "Generate with AI" button. The status bar will prompt you to type
  - Type your desired modification or generation prompt (e.g., "a cat wearing a hat", "make this blue")
  - Press Enter. Gemini will process the current canvas image with your prompt
  - The canvas will update with the AI-generated image

- **Veo - Video Animation (V)**:
  - Ensure there's a drawing on the canvas
  - Press 'V' or click the "Video with Veo" button
  - The application will use the current canvas image and a fixed internal prompt ("animate keep the style Keep the same minimal line doodle style.") to generate a video
  - Monitor the status bar for progress (Initializing ‚Üí Generating ‚Üí Polling ‚Üí Done/Error)
  - Generated videos (MP4) are saved in the project's root directory (e.g., `veo_video_12345_0.mp4`)
  - **Note**: Video generation can take several minutes. The UI will remain responsive during polling

- **Exiting**: Close the Pygame window or press Ctrl+C in the terminal where it's running.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

Advanced parameters like FPS, default colors, API model names, and Veo generation settings (default aspect ratio, duration) can be tweaked in:
`src/graficador/config.py`

## üîÆ Potential Future Enhancements

- Advanced color picker and custom palettes
- Image import/export options
- Layer management system
- Undo/Redo functionality
- More sophisticated brush/drawing tools
- UI controls for Veo parameters (prompt, duration, aspect ratio)
- In-app video playback
- Inpainting/Outpainting with Gemini using drawn masks
